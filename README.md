# CacheSim

## Project Description

A cache simulation program to demonstrate the Hit/Miss actions in L1, Victim and L2 caches, and retrieval of data from the cache and RAM, animated for a better visualisation. Direct cache mapping and set associative mapping have been simulated in the backend for the respective processes.

## Working/Bugs

- [x] Animations
- [x] Button clicks
- [x] Data loading
- [ ] CPU Lines not scaling with monitor size (works good only on 2560x1440 or resized 16:9 monitors)
- [ ] Frequency of Hit extremely low (due to high number of lines and large sizes)
- [ ] L1, Victim and L2 Hit-only animations (multiple unnecessary animations play out)
- [ ] Some bugs in backend where L2 isn't working as expected
- [ ] Better data representation
